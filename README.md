<h1>Background</h1> <hr>
In the steel industry, materials like coils, sheets, and slabs are transported via railway wagons grouped into rakes. Each wagon is divided into three loading zones—W1, W2, and W3—each with specific dimensional and weight constraints.

To ensure safe and balanced loading, the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) under Indian Railways has issued detailed safety and loading guidelines.

<h1>Objective</h1> <hr>
This project aims to develop an initial heuristic-based solution to allocate steel materials to wagons in a manner that adheres to key RDSO norms, avoiding overloading and ensuring safe, stable transport.

<h1>Additional Features</h1> <hr>
An ML model based on RandomForest classification to predict Coil placement. <br>
**Note**: This feature is an additional component added out of curiosity. Although it has an accuracy of 80%, it is recommended to rely primarily on the heuristic.
